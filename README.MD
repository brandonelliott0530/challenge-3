# Challenge 3: Password Generator

## Usage

To use the password generator, you will need to open the web-page, and click on the "Generate password" button near the bottom of the box. You will then be prompted with a series of questions. The questions inclue: How many characters would you like your password to contain, would you like to use lower-case letters, upper-case letters, numbers, and special characters. The program will then generate the password according to the user's choices.
